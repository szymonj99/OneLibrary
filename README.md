# OneLibrary - Cross-Platform Input Hooking Library
OneLibrary is a C++ library that allows you to more easily create applications that interact with user input.

# Examples
See [examples](docs/examples).
TODO: Add examples here as well as the docs.

# How To Use
- Using [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) by adding `CPMAddPackage("gh:szymonj99/OneLibrary#{COMMIT_HASH_HERE}")`
- Your own way of adding a C++ library of choice

# License
See the [license file](LICENSE) (subject to change)

# Project Structure
```
./src   - The source files for the library
./tests - The test files
```

# Get Started - CMake Build
```shell
git clone https://github.com/szymonj99/OneLibrary
cd OneLibrary
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

# CMake Files Style
- Use `TRUE` and `FALSE` rather than `ON` or `OFF`

# Developing With Local Changes
If you want to make changes to this library, you can test these changes locally.
For example, if you have a project that uses this as a dependency through [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake), you can instead do the following:
1. `git clone git@github.com:szymonj99/OneLibrary.git` one level up from your current project
2. Add `CPMAddPackage(NAME OneLibrary PATHS ../OneLibrary)` to your `CMakeLists.txt` to add in the dependency from local files.
For further information, see [this](https://github.com/szymonj99/OneControl/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt).
